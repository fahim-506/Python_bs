A text example is any instance of communication that can be read,
 interpreted, and understood, not limited to written words like a book,
  but also encompassing visual elements such as paintings, maps, or even a street sign.
   Texts convey information and meaning through a system of signs and can range from a simple word 
   ("STOP" on a sign) to a complex novel or a collection of buildings.
